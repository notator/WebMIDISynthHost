#### Third Party Software

1. Sergey Surikov's WebAudioFont software is covered by the [GNU General Public Licence v3.0](https://github.com/surikov/webaudiofont/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
2. The Arachno SoundFont does not allow commercial use.<br />
The [original Arachnosoft Read Me](https://james-ingram-act-two.de/soundFonts/Arachno/Read%20Me.txt) is included in the folder containing the soundFont itself, and contains the following IMPORTANT LICENSING INFORMATION:<br />
"Most portions of this bank actually come from other sources (SoundFont
and GigaSampler libraries, third-party synthesizer samples) that
have been credited in the bundled documentation.<br />
You're free to use Arachno SoundFont in any of your projects. But,
please be aware that this bank is primarily distributed for private,
non-commercial purposes only, as it uses portions from other authors.<br />
If you want to use it for commercial purposes, please obtain a written
consent from the original authors credited in the documentation."
3. As far as I can ascertain, the TimGM6mb soundFont is in the public domain. If this is not the case, please let me know.<br />
I downloaded it from the [VirtualMIDISynth site](https://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth). 
4. Links to the WebAudioFont presets used by the ResidentWAFSynth were found via Surikov's [WebAudioFont page](https://surikov.github.io/webaudiofontdata/sound/).<br />
The presets originated in two soundFonts:
   - [GeneralUser GS licence](http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php)
   - [FluidR3 licence](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/blob/master/share/sound/FluidR3Mono_License.md)
